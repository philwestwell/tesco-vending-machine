# Tesco Vending Machine

A private Github repo to model a vending machine's state during operation.
 
1. The machine accepts the following coins

* 10p
* 20p
* 50p
* £1

2. The machine vends three types of item

* Item A costing £0.60
* Item B costing £1.00
* Item C costing £1.70

3. The machine responds to the following messages

* insertCoin

takes a parameter of single coin (see above for valid coins) and updates the balance

* returnCoins

returns coins representing the current balance (does not need to be the same coins)

* purchaseItem

takes a parameter of a single item (see above for valid items) and returns coins representing the unused balance

* turnOn

loads the current persisted state for the number of coins and products of each type

accepts new transactions    
 
* turnOff

no longer accepts requests
 
# Assumptions

1. The coin slot hardware has responsibility to filter out unsupported tokens (Euros, washers etc) without notifying the software
2. At present it's not clear whether the hardware would take care of coins and requests when powered off (arguably if there is no power then there is no software either) so need to double check with the stakeholders how this all works

# To get the code

1. Clone this repo from Github
2. Download the Maven dependencies
* command line
``` mvn clean install ```
* Eclipse
``` Project, Clean ```
* Intellij
Should download dependencies automatically. If not then open the IDE's terminal command window, then 
``` mvn clean install ```

# Features of the code
1. If infinitest is installed in your IDE to support faster TDD, then filters can be applied using file 
` infinitest.filters `
2. Mockito is included in the dependencies. Mockito is useful in TDD particularly for the following scenarios
* checking that dependent objects were called in the expected way
* setting up a specific response from a dependant object
When developing this project, take care not to mock inadvertently the code you are trying to execute in the test!

3. Some sample BDD Cucumber tests are included. If this code was being developed as an agile project, the BDD tests for the next show and tell would be added at the start of the sprint. 

# todo
* Develop product compartment
* Update BDD features 
* Check Maven build
* Review responsibilities of classes and refactor as appropriate so that the code is easy to change. Design principles to consider
..* Separate what changes from what stays the same
..* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Add BDD tests
* Run PITest mutation test tool to test the tests
* Run static code analysis tool
* Incorporate as part of CI Build
